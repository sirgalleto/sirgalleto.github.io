        <h1>Report Large Coursework</h1>
        <p>Carlos Sebastián Osorio Parada</p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Galleto is my brand over the internet, and this brand represents what
          I believe: In the open divulgation of knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a solid believer in the open-source and communities to increase
          the acceleration of the innovation in the technology field, especially
          in the software development side.
        </p>
        <p>Galleto has been part of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>GDLJS (the JS community in the city) leadership.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>GDLDevComs + Posadev conf.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>NodeConfEU 2010.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some of the things I want to communicate to the world
          about <strong>Galleto</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Who I am: There is one practical reason why it is essential to show
            the people I am from Latin America. Latin American people usually
            think that they are not in the same world as other continents or
            more development.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My projects: I like to create open code, I need to showcase my
            projects and navigate them from my landing page to those projects.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My thoughts: I have opinions about several topics on the internet.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My photos: One of my hobbies is photography, which is my more
            sharable way to represent my feelings; I want to showcase them.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A way to contact: I have different social networks with other
            objectives. The users of my web page should be able to find those
            social networks and navigate to them.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Inspirations</h1>
        <p>
          I don&#x27;t want to overstress a person using my website, I want to
          keep concrete about the thoughts I wish to share, so the principal
          value on the design needs to be <strong
            >minimal and straightforward.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to focus the page viewer on the content over impress the people
          with a design guide. The content should be <strong>sober</strong> and
          easy to <strong>read and navigate through</strong>.
        </p>

            <a href="http://javier.xyz/">http://javier.xyz/</a> One friend with
            some of the same values as me, but with way more experience and
            projects to showcase, all of his projects listed there has been
            famous for a while.
          </li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://trevordmiller.com/">https://trevordmiller.com/</a>.
            Is a page of an open-source-related guy that has relevant projects
            that I use.

            ex-coworker whom his page shares most of the same values and
            objectives as me.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Accessibility</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Accessibility needs non-complex flow of control: We need to create
            sites that do not execute complicated behaviors and arrangements; it
            can generate a simple flow of usage by using a small set of
            peripherical devices options. If complex layouts are introduced,
            with the help of Wai aria, we can describe the order or lecture for
            the devices.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using the semantics of html correctly: By using the tags correctly,
            we give the browser engine information that can be translated easily
            to the end-user. For example, use a button for buttons (or at least
            declaring the role button on buttons), adding an alt to the images,
            using navigation tags for navigations, header, footer, Etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using contrasting colors makes it easier to see the content avoiding
            fatigue or confusion to people with a certain level of visual
            impairment.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Usability</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Re-used navigation components: The header and footer components
            contain the main links you need to go over the different pages.
            Those components are shared along with the application, so once the
            user gets familiar with the navigation components, it can quickly
            navigate through the application.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A large view of what&#x27;s important, the projects: The projects
            page contains all the projects, so the user has a statement with no
            distraction and the complete catalog of the page&#x27;s main
            interest. Also, under the &quot;recent projects&quot; section, a
            link redirects the user to the all-projects page.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Contact form, the power of simplicity: So many times, we fill a
            complex form with different information that we don&#x27;t know the
            process. The contact form developed in this site takes advantage of
            the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6068"
              >mailto URI scheme</a
            > to use your email client to send a message. So all the process of
            messaging is clear and reliable to the end-user.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Things that I learned</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I had to re-learn how to use handlebars: I used handlebars before,
            but it was not the robust project that is today. I needed to learn
            how to manage the pre-compiled templates and create a process to
            continually pre-compile the templates I developed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Responsive design Media queries: I work as a software engineer, but
            in my projects, I don&#x27;t usually spend too much time doing
            responsive design. I had to google and investigate what are the best
            sizes to handle most of my necessities.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The &lt;template/&gt; tag and outherHtml: To ingest handlebars
            templates in the cleanest way, I remembered that the template tag is
            used for this kind of situations: Is a component that is not visible
            to the client, making it a semantical option to use it as a
            placeholder until rendering the handlebars output in the outerHtml
            which overrides the DOM template node.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you have a component with specific with when you add padding,
            this width increases. I broke most of my layout thinking that
            padding works as a margin (that does not affect the box width); once
            I realized this, I had to change my approach to reduce the component
            width by the padding, mostly using width: calc(originalWidth -
            paddingSum)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>What worked well</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            One of the issues of writing plain JavaScript is the separation of
            scripts, so you don&#x27;t end up writing all your code in one
            single file. Even though you can write in each script&#x27;s global
            scope, it is a bad practice for large codebases, primarily when your
            code performs mutations, and you can mutate global variables that
            you didn&#x27;t need to have access to. My solution for separating
            code and sharing it across modules is based on the following
            separation:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create a helper script/module that exports to window.helpers and
            handlebars the utility functions. One example is the renderTemplate
            function that contains the abstraction to get a template from
            handlebars and render it in a template.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a data module that exports to window.data</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All scripts are executed in an IFFE (immediately invoked function
            expression) so any variable declared belongs to the IFFE scope, and
            the only way to deal with other scripts/modules is by sharing code
            using a common window pattern.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fetching the projects&#x27; readme from GitHub: This option
            simplified the implementation of multiple posts re-using the openly
            available readme information.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            BEM: This is a naming convention for writing CSS that I learned a
            couple of years ago. It separates the creation of the classes into
            to block, elements, and modifiers. The elements are objects that
            work alone, a block is a conjunction of components, and the modifier
            is a modification to any block or element style.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using node + npm to use development utils: I used the handlebars CLI
            and parcel to having an environment able to reload my changes
            quickly. Using npm scripts made my life easier, and the process of
            developing faster.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>What aspect of the work could be improved</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Mobile-first makes media queries less complicated: I started to code
            the site using a desktop as the base, then started with mobile, and
            then a tablet. At this point, I lost control of the properties I was
            changing, then I realized that my responsive behavior was working
            for mobile devices, but if I reduced the size of the window, it was
            not working. I found some information about my approach of using
            media queries, combining min-width and max-width. I needed to use
            just one like creating a sort of waterfall of mobile styles to the
            larger screen. As I lose control of my responsive styles, I could
            not perform the refactoring on time for this submission.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Handlebars is an excellent library, but it kills the SEO: The search
            engine optimization doesn&#x27;t execute javascript in most cases,
            so they do not reach all the vital content rendered as a template
            from handlebars, hence, this page won&#x27;t perform well on search
            engines.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Lazy load of images: I managed to create a great photo grid, but my
            image takes too long to load and for a second feels like the
            site&#x27;s UI thread is blocked. This is a result of the
            browser&#x27;s limits of an http-request and the size of the photos.
            It can be improved by fetching a fixed small number of photos first,
            and then continue fetching the photos as the user is navigating in
            the grid.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Github readme broken links: The github readme contains relatives
            urls that cannot be accesed by my site. Not all are relatives, but
            some of them are broken.
          </li>
        </ul>
